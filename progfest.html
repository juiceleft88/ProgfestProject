    <h1> The Challenge </h1>
    <p> 

        <u>This year's ProgFest will be different from prior years.</u> It consists of data structure and algorithm
        exercises within Android applications. The first part of the day will be a 2 hour hands-on workshop
        on creating very basic Android applications. The rest of the day will involve creating Android games
        that require the use of relatively sophisticated algorithms and data structures.
        
        <ul>
        <li>All exercises will be done in Java (with a small amount of XML) - a good grasp of Java is required.</li>
        
        <li>Knowledge of at least these Java data structures is needed: HashMaps, ArrayLists, Sets, Trees, Tries.</li>
        
        <li>Knowledge of recursion would be helpful, along with algorithms such as breadth-first search and depth-first
        search.</li>
        
        <li>Knowledge of basic text Java IO would also be helpful.</li>
        
        <li>Practice using Android Studio and deploying Android apps to an emulator will make doing the projects
        easier. </li>
        
        </ul>
