    <h1> The Challenge </h1>
    <p> 

        <u>This year's ProgFest will be different from prior years.</u> It consists of data structure and algorithm
        exercises within Android applications. The first part of the day will be a 2 hour hands-on workshop
        on creating very basic Android applications. The rest of the day will involve creating Android games
        that require the use of relatively sophisticated algorithms and data structures.
        
        All exercises will be done in Java (with a small amount of XML) - a good grasp of Java is required.
        
        Knowledge of at least these Java data structures is needed: HashMaps, ArrayLists, Sets, Trees, Tries.
        
        Knowledge of recursion would be helpful, along with algorithms such as breadth-first search and depth-first
        search.
        
        Knowledge of basic text Java IO would also be helpful.
        
        Practice using Android Studio and deploying Android apps to an emulator will make doing the projects
        easier.
